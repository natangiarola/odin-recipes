        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 passion fruits</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 cups cream</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Break passion fruits in half, and empty contents into a bowl. Use a little water to help rinse the juice out of the skins. Mix with hands to soften pulp. Strain through a sieve or cheesecloth. Stir in sugar and sweetened condensed milk.</li>
            <li>In a chilled bowl, beat cream until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the cream into the passion fruit mixture, then quickly fold in remaining cream until no streaks remain. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
